# Backend MVC Pattern

The backend for Devgree.com is organized based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Here's a breakdown of the directory structure:

- **models/**: This is where you define your data structures and logic related to the database. In the context of Devgree.com, it's for MongoDB schemas.
- **views/**: In the context of an API, this is typically unused. However, it's retained in case there's a need to render any views server-side.
- **controllers/**: This directory will contain the business logic for your routes.
- **routes/**: Here, you'll define your API endpoints.
- **middleware/**: This will host functions that execute before the controllers. This can include authentication, error handling, rate limiting, etc.
- **utils/**: This is for utility functions that might be used across multiple controllers or other parts of your app.
- **lib/**: Any custom integrations or configurations for third-party libraries would reside here.
- **graphql/**: Contains all GraphQL related files, given the transition to GraphQL.
- **config/**: This directory is for configuration files, such as the ones for database connection configurations.
- **tests/**: All test cases related to the backend will be found here.
